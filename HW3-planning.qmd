1. I plan to pursue option 1

2. My questions have changed. They are now:

Overarching questions: 
Have fish/organism catches at each site changed over time?

Sub-questions: 
What is the most caught organism at each site over time?
What is the amount of unique catch types of organisms (over time?) by site?
What are the abiotic differences between each site? (water temp, weather, location, etc)


3. Variables needed for each question

question 1: What is the most caught organism at each site over time?

From the raw data from `fish_02_24` I created a cleaned data set that changed all column names to lower snake case and got rid of any columns with over 750,000 NAs (too many NAs to be a helpful metric to use). From the cleaned dataset, `fish_clean`, I will use the variable `sample_date`, which will give me the time element. I will also use the variable `common_name` (or `iep_fish_code` if I want shorter labels). Lastly, I will use the `location` column to group the catches by site. 

question 2: What is the amount of unique catch types of organisms over time by site?

This question will use the same variables as the last question, `sample_date`, `location`, and `common_name` (or `iep_fish_code`), but used differently. Instead of looking at the "mode" (the most observed organism at each site), we will instead focus on organism type, where the amount of observations doesn't matter. We will simply be looking at the unique names of organisms observed at each site. 

question 3: What are the abiotic differences between each site? 

For this question we will use the `location`, `water_temp`, and `weather_code` from the `fish_clean` dataset. I will also use the `locals` dataset to look at `longitude` and `latitude` in order to compare site locations. I plan to use the lat and long to create a very simple map showing site locations relative to eachother. 


4. Data visualization inspiration 

![plot of wind turbine densities in Canada, but shaped like canada and using the colors of the flag](images/Screenshot_map.png)
Potential idea for displaying abiotic features. I like the idea of using a map of the site or of the bay area in general to show average water temperature, weather, and to also represent location. Would need to play around with how to implement this idea, but could be fun 


![stacked bar plot](images/Screenshot_bar.png)

Possible inspo for max organism caught by site over time. I think a stacked barplot could be cool if I find that the organisms have a little bit of consistency and aren't differing completely each year. I think each site could be on the x axis and time could be on the y. I liked this chart specifically because it showed the information in a both aesthetic and helpful way.

#### I'm way too frustrated with max catch type, let's move on

## What is the amount of unique catch types of organisms by site?

would be cool to make in the shape of fish or somehow water related

```{r}
fish_unique <- fish_clean |> 
  select(location, common_name, sample_date) |> 
  group_by(location) |> 
  summarize(nunique = n_distinct(common_name))

  geom_col(color = "blue3", fill = "navy", width = 1) +
  geom_text(aes(label = nunique, 
                vjust = 4), 
            color = "white", 
            size = 5,
            family = "outfit") +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0, NA)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, NA), limits = c(0, 80)) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Unique Species Caught at Each Location"
  ) +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    # I anticipate changing the style of the title in affinity so I'll leave it for now
    title = element_text(family = "outfit"),
    axis.text = element_text(family = "outfit",
                             size = 12),

question 3: What are the abiotic differences between each site? 
plan: x and y are lat long (need to join locals dataframe)
scatter plot with color = avg. water temp at each site
shape = avg. weather at each site (have shape be the shape of weather ie. sun, cloud, rain cloud, etc)
 

wrangling
```{r}
locals_sites <- locals |> 
  filter(Location == c("Chipps Island", "Benicia", "Mossdale", "Sherwood Harbor")) |> 
  select(Location, Latitude, Longitude) |> 
  clean_names()

fish_abiotic <- fish_clean |> 
  select(location, weather_code, water_temp) |> 
  na.omit(water_temp, weather_code) 
  

fish_water <- fish_abiotic |> 
  group_by(location) |> 
  summarize(avg_water_temp = mean(water_temp)) 

fish_weather <- fish_abiotic |> 
  group_by(location) |> 
  summarize(weather = DescTools::Mode(weather_code))

fish_join <- fish_weather |> 
  full_join(fish_water, join_by(location)) 

local_join <- fish_join |> 
  full_join(locals_sites, join_by(location)) 

```

plot 
*I will overlay a map on this to show the location of each site*
```{r}
sun_shape <- '&#xf185'

ggplot(data = local_join, aes(y = latitude, x = longitude, color = avg_water_temp)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  # geom_text(label = sun_shape, size = 6) 
labs(
  title = "Differences Between Sites",

7. Answer the following questions:


a. What challenges did you encounter or anticipate encountering as you continue to build / iterate on your visualizations in R? If you struggled with mocking up any of your three visualizations (from #6, above), describe those challenges here.

I struggled A LOT with the axis for date in my first visualization. I couldn't figure out how to make the scale what I wanted it to be and make it legible. Without figuring out that step, I couldn't continue working on the finer details of my plot and making it make sense. I want to eventually add annotations to my plot, but it's difficult if I can't even see the axes.

I also struggled with font awesome. I wanted to change the shape of my last scatter plot dots to a sun to represent the average weather at each location. I tried a bunch of methods, but couldn't quite figure out how to add them in R. 


b. What ggplot extension tools / packages do you need to use to build your visualizations? Are there any that we haven’t covered in class that you’ll be learning how to use for your visualizations?

I'm using `showtext()` for my fonts, and would like to eventually use `ggforce` for cool annotations. I also used `scales` in my plots. To do the wrangling I used `DescTools` to find the mode weather at each site, which is something I don't believe we've talked about in class.


c. What feedback do you need from the instructional team and / or your peers to ensure that your intended message is clear?


My first plot is definitely my messiest, so I would love any feedback about how to make it clearer/ change my plots. I also want to make sure that the overarching question of "Are Marine Species Changing in the San Francisco Estuary?" is clear. I might have to change the question to something about changes throughout the estuary instead of throughout time. Feedback on the ~vibes~ of the infographic would also be great. I'm going for very playful and water themed. And please feel free to help me with any of the code I'm stuck on!
